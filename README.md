# HowTo-Test
How To (do the same things) Testing Edition is a repository where I store all that commands, procedures and code snippets that are every time the same but you do not remember because you need them only one time a month or year so you need to google for them every single time.

## Introduction

This repository is divided in main and sub topics. 
It is possible that some things are omitted because were or are going to be discussed elsewhere.


## Docker

In order to test the integration with databases I create a simple docker compose file with both mysql and postgres.

Be sure to disable your databases if you want to run this docker script or change the port binding 
(remember to change the ports also in the properties files).
